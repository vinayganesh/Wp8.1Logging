Wp8.1Logging
============

Logging is the most essential feature in the field of software development. When you are developing a windows phone application, it is really important that every action of the user of any particular app is logged. This is at the least to make sure that every event is captured and if there  are any errors or exceptions it is caught in the logs. 

WriteToText is a sample application that can be used to log every activity that occurs in the application. This application, creates a sample text file which logs sample text into the file and it logs the exceptions as well.
